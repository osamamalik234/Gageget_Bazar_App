## Problem Identification

The problem faced by people is the manual process of purchasing gadgets. Traditional gadget purchasing methods involve physical stores, which can be time-consuming and often result in limited options. Customers may encounter the following issues:

Limited Availability: In physical stores, customers are constrained by the inventory available, which may not offer the latest or most diverse gadgets.
Inconvenience: Shopping for gadgets in physical stores can be time-consuming, requiring travel and potentially dealing with crowds.
Geographical Limitations: People living in remote areas may have limited access to gadget stores, making it challenging to purchase the latest technology.
Lack of Information: Physical stores might not provide sufficient information and reviews about the gadgets, making it difficult for customers to make informed decisions.
Payment Hassles: Traditional purchasing often involves carrying cash or credit cards, which can be inconvenient and potentially risky.
